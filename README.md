Description:
An application for users to find recycling locations near them, see environmental news in their area, be able to post their own updates and articles and interact with each other, and obtain information on environmental charities and organizations.

“An interactive site to connect conscientious users as they strive to commit to eco-friendly practices in order to better the environment of their communities and around the world.”

MVP:
Home Page: Showcase application and description, contains user login
Recycle Near You: Uses API to find recycling locations
Char & Org: Lists charities/organizations that benefit environment
NewsFeed: Uses API to link news stories related to environment and recycling
Community: Page for users to interact--they can post comments and articles of their own and communicate with other users

Initial User Stories:
“As a user, I want to be able to find recycling locations near me, and other events or groups in my community that may benefit the environment.”
“As a user, I want to see a newsfeed with articles and links related to my community and beneficial environment practices without having to search for them myself.”
“As a user, I want to be able to meet and communicate with like-minded individuals in my community who are also interested in pro-environment lifestyles.”
